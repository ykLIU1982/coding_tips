    "We can use \"pip\" command to install a Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "If install a module in the **command line**, simply call the \"pip\" function.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In some case, the offical \"pip\" library may not contain the module package we are looking for. In such as case, we can either choose the unoffical Python modules or use some other Python code distributions, e.g., anaconda's conda.\n",

    "### Embedding Variables in a String\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are important and widely used in Python codes. We have a few ways to create a string and embed variables in it.  \n",
    "E.g., we can use .format() method to embed one or more variables into a string.  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "var = 15\n",
    "var1 = 'Tom'\n",
    "a = 'This is a string containing a variable with the value of {}'.format(var)\n",
    "a = '{} has {} toys'.format(var1, var)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "My personal preferred way is to use the f-string method. I found two advantages in this method. First, the execution is faster as the variables are loaded in real-time. Second, the variables are embedded into the string so that it is easier to check their positions in the context.  \n",
    "E.g., we can rewrite the above example as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var = 15\n",
    "var1 = 'Tom'\n",
    "a = f'This is string with a variable of {var}'\n",
    "a = f'{var1} has {var} toys'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a float value, we can format it in the string.\n",
    "E.g., \n",
    "```python\n",
    "var = 1234567890.87654321\n",
    "a = f'var is shown as {var:,.4f}'\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, we use \":,.4f\" to format the display of the float value. First, **\",\"** is to enable the separator display for a very large number, e.g., \"1,234,567,890\". Second, **\".4f\"** controls the display of digits after the decimal point to up to four, i.e., \"1,234,567,890.8765\".\n",

    "This cls parameter is the class object which allows @classmethod methods to easily instantiate the class, regardless of any inheritance going on.
